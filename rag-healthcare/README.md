# RAG for Healthcare Document QA

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to answer questions from healthcare-related documents such as insurance claims and clinical records.

## Notebook
- [rag-healthcare.ipynb](./rag-healthcare.ipynb) – Full walkthrough: loading docs, embeddings, retrieval, and answering questions.
- [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zanvari/llm-lab/blob/main/rag-healthcare/rag-healthcare.ipynb)

## Use Case
Given one or more healthcare documents (PDF/text), answer questions such as:
- What is the patient's diagnosis?
- What treatment was administered?
- Who is the policyholder and what amount was claimed?

## Pipeline Overview
- Load PDF(s)
- Chunk and embed with `sentence-transformers`
- Retrieve relevant context with FAISS
- Answer using GPT-3.5 via LangChain

## Install Requirements
