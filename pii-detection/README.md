# PII Detection

This project detects Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in text using both traditional NER methods and LLM-based prompts.

## Methods
- **spaCy NER** for rule-based entity recognition
- **LLM (OpenAI GPT)** for zero-shot PII detection
- *(Optional)* HuggingFace transformer-based NER models

## Notebook
- [`pii_detection.ipynb`](./pii_detection.ipynb): Compare traditional and LLM-based PII detection
