Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made tremendous strides in recent years, transforming industries and redefining the way we interact with technology. From healthcare to finance, AI applications have led to increased efficiency, personalized services, and improved outcomes. However, ethical concerns regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for job displacement continue to grow. Regulators and researchers are now pushing for explainable AI and frameworks that ensure transparency and accountability. As generative models like GPT evolve, the boundaries between human and machine-generated content blur, demanding thoughtful governance.
