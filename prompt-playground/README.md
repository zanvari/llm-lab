# Prompt Engineering Playground

This project explores different prompt styles and their effect on LLM outputs. It provides a simple interface to experiment with:

- Zero-shot prompts
- Few-shot prompts
- Chain-of-thought reasoning

## Notebook
- [`prompt_playground.ipynb`](./prompt_playground.ipynb): Compare outputs from multiple LLMs on various prompt strategies.

## Structure
```
prompt-playground/
├── data/
│   └── prompts.json             # Example prompts (task, type, input)
├── outputs/                     # Saved logs or comparisons
├── prompt_playground.ipynb      # Main notebook
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

## Models Used (Simulated)
- OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4)
- Mistral
- LLaMA

You can integrate real APIs by replacing the simulated `query_*` functions in the notebook.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.
