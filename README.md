# 🧪 LLM Lab

Welcome to `llm-lab` — a curated collection of projects, experiments, and research prototypes focused on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Generative AI**. This lab is designed to showcase hands-on applications and practical workflows across areas like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), document intelligence, fine-tuning, and more.
